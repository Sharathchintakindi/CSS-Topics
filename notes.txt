The Element selector
Element selectors are used to provide styling to a selected HTML document.

The universal selector
We use an asterisk (*) sign to define the universal selector in the universal selector. It is used to select all the Html documents.

*{
      property: value  

}

 Id selector
It is the most commonly used operator in CSS. It is used to set the style to a given id. It is denoted by (#).

#id {  
    property: value;  
} 

The Class Selector
The class selector is used to select elements that have some class attributes. We use a (.) character with a specific class to select an element.

.class{
  property: value
}
